\title{Predict alongside a Transformer model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{Transformer}(
  object,
  newdata,
  type = c("embed-sentence", "embed-token", "tokenise"),
  trace = 10,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class Transformer as returned by \code{\link{transformer}}}

\item{newdata}{a data.frame with columns doc_id and text indicating the text to embed}

\item{type}{a character string, either 'embed-sentence', 'embed-token', 'tokenise' to get respectively sentence-level embeddings, token-level embeddings or the subword tokens}

\item{trace}{logical indicating to show a trace of the progress. Defaults to showing every 10 annotated embeddings}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to the methods}
}
\value{
depending on the argument \code{type} the function returns:
\itemize{
\item embed-sentence: A matrix with the embedding of the text, where the doc_id's are in the rownames
\item embed-token: A list of matrices with token-level embeddings, one for each doc_id. The names of the list are identified by the doc_id. Note that depending on the model you will have CLS / SEP tokens at the start/back and the number of rows of the matrix is also limited by the model
\item tokenise: A list of subword tokens, depending on the Transformer architecture related tokenizer (could be wordpiece, BPE, ...). The names of the list are identified by the doc_id.
}
}
\description{
Extract features from the Transformer model namely get
\itemize{
\item the embedding of a sentence
\item the embedding of the tokens of the sentence
\item the tokens of a sentence
}
}
